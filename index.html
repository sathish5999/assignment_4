Chicken - the miracle meat
Chicken is one of those meat items that finds its place in all Indian meals. A favorite among all age groups, chicken is not only easily available, but is also nutritious and healthy if consumed in right quantities.

This lean meat can do wonders for all those non-vegetarians when consumed in a controllable manner. Implementing healthier food habits in our diets ensures a good body and better immunity. So here goes some of the numerous benefits of the delightful chicken!

Nutritional value of chicken
While chicken is a lean meat with loads of proteins, it is also high on cholesterol. However, chicken provides selenium which contains antioxidants that help control free radicals and improve your immune system.

A 100gms of cooked chicken would usually contain 239 calories. Of 100gms, 27gms would be only protein which is important for growth and development of various organs in the body. Besides, chicken also helps in maintaining the desired body weight. Furthermore, it gives zinc and iron and is an excellent source for Vitamins B6, B12 and D.

What you get when you consume chicken?
Body weight maintenance:  With chicken being an excellent source of high quality protein, it helps in maintaining body weight especially for obese people. Adequate protein quantities would mean that your stomach stays full leaving no scope for binge eating. Including chicken two to three times in a week is not a bad idea, however, ensure to cook it in a healthy way.

That toned figure that you desired:  Do you aspire to have a muscular and toned body, then chicken is your answer. The high protein content would give you the necessary energy to function properly. However, do ensure to balance it out with enough macro and micro nutrients in your diet.</p></div></a>

        <div id="Beef-tile"><span>Beef</span><p>Meat is animal flesh that is eaten as food.Humans have hunted and killed animals for meat since prehistoric times. The advent of civilization allowed the domestication of animals such as chickens, sheep, rabbits, pigs and cattle. This eventually led to their use in meat production on an industrial scale with the aid of slaughterhouses.

Meat is mainly composed of water, protein, and fat. It is edible raw, but is normally eaten after it has been cooked and seasoned or processed in a variety of ways. Unprocessed meat will spoil or rot within hours or days as a result of infection with and decomposition by bacteria and fungi.

Meat is important in economy and culture, even though its mass production and consumption has been determined to pose risks for human health and the environment. Many religions have rules about which meat may or may not be eaten. Vegetarians and vegans may abstain from eating meat because of concerns about the ethics of eating meat, environmental effects of meat production or nutritional effects of consumption.</p></div></a>

        <div id="Sushi-tile"><span>Sushi</span><p>Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯ̥ɕiꜜ] or [sɯ̥ꜜɕi]) is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients (ネタ, neta), such as seafood, vegetables, and occasionally tropical fruits. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).[1]

Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.

Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish, or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.</p></div></a>
